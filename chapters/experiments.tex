\chapter{Experiments}
\label{cha:experiments}
In order to verify the theory and method whose implementation is described in the previous chapters, a number of experiments are performed.

The experiments are designed to verify or examine the following properties of the system:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The actual PA10 joint configuration versus the desired configuration.
    \item Correctness of the estimated target 3D position obtained by triangulation. %todo
    \item The error between the detected target 3D position and the Kalman filter prediction.
    \item Paths planned for obstacle avoidance in the environment.
\end{itemize}


\section{Joint positional error}\label{sec:joint_error}
The first experiment to be carried out is to explore whether the PA10 correctly reaches the desired configurations.
Variations between the true (as reported by the PA10 controller) and desired configurations can easily affect other parts of the system.

The experiment is performed by sending a number of desired joint configurations to the PA10 controller and afterwards reading back the resulting configuration as reported by the controller node. Figure~\ref{fig:q_real_desired} shows the resulting data.

    }
    \caption{Real configuration as reported by the PA10 controller versus the desired configuration for the first 3 joints.}
    \label{fig:q_real_desired}
\end{figure}


An optimal performance of the system would yield a minimal or none difference between current and desired configurations.
However, the results shows otherwise.
It can be seen that for big steps between the input and current joint positions the actuators do not behave as intended.
This loss of the expected path is translated into small disruptions in the robot movements that can be seen when following the target.
The mistakes in the behavior can be partially due to errors in the mechanical part, but more likely to constraints in the PA10 controller

Further probing reveals that this problem is not common in PA10 models, but the particular one used in this project has an error.
At the time of writing, no measures have been taken to solve the problem, but a suggested solution could be manually implement a limit to how much a joint may be moved in on step.
If the desired move is greater than the limit, the system should split the move into several smaller ones.

\section{Detected object position and Kalman filter estimate}
To show that the Kalman filter is working as expected, predicting the ball position even in cases where the detection algorithm fails momentarily, the following experiment is conducted.

The PA10 robot configuration and thus the stereo camera position is kept constant.
The object to be tracked -- a ball -- is then moved slowly inside the view of the cameras.
At some point, the ball is obscured, so that the tracking algorithm no longer succeeds in detecting it.
That is the point at which the Kalman filter predictions become particularly important to keep track of the ball.
Especially so in cases where the ball would have otherwise moved out of sight of the cameras while occluded.

\begin{figure}[htb]

    \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.49\textwidth}
        \resizebox{\columnwidth}{!}{%
            \input{figures/ball_kalman_3d_tikz}
        }
        \caption{Detected path of the ball and Kalman estimate.}
        \label{fig:ball_kalman_3d}
    \end{subfigure}~
    \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.49\textwidth}
        \resizebox{\columnwidth}{!}{%
            \input{figures/ball_kalman_error_tikz}
        }
        \caption{Positional difference between detected ball position and Kalman estimate.}
        \label{fig:ball_kalman_error}
    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{Detected ball positions and associated Kalman filter estimates.}
    \label{fig:kalman_test}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:kalman_test} shows a 16 second excerpt of positional data gathered by the ball detection algorithm and Kalman filter.
Figure~\ref{fig:ball_kalman_3d} depicts the 3D positions while \ref{fig:ball_kalman_error} shows the difference between the last measured ball position and Kalman filter estimate. Associated samples (at the same time) are the same color.

At 71 seconds the ball is no longer detected for approximately 3 seconds, so the ``detected'' position remains constant. The Kalman filter continues predicting the ball position based on previous samples however. This may be be seen in the error graph; the difference between detected ball position and the estimate grows quickly until around 74 seconds, where the ball is once again detected correctly in the camera images.

In general, whenever the ball changes direction, velocity or acceleration the error is likely to increase because the Kalman filter is yet uncorrected. If the object to be tracked is not detected, the filter update step is skipped entirely.


\section{Paths planning around obstacles}
When no straight-line between configurations is available (because of obstacles in the work cell), an RRT planning algorithm is applied.
To verify that the path generation does indeed work and can move the robotic arm around obstacles, an experiment is designed in a simulated environment.

In this experiment obstacles are placed in the virtual scene description, as depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:collision_avoidance}, a screen capture from RobWorkStudio.

\begin{figure}[htb]

    \caption{The robot follows the ball avoiding collide with the virtual obstacles}
    \label{fig:collision_avoidance}
\end{figure}

A video with the robot avoiding the obstacles have been taken and can be seen online \cite{results2}.

The experiment that configurations for moving the robotic arm around obstacles are indeed generated and sent to the robot controller.
