\label{cha:conclusions}
The developed system has been successfully tested in both simulation and the workcell, and subjected to experiments to measure the magnitude of the errors in the performance, as showed in Chapter \ref{cha:experiments}.
It has proved robustness and reliability, although certain limits imposed by the robot conditions hve constrained the goodness of the final results.
